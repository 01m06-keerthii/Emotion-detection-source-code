# Emotion Detection with Animated Line Plot

This project detects emotions from text data using a transformer model.  
It uses HuggingFace's `distilroberta-base` model for accurate emotion classification.  
The results are visualized through an animated, colorful line graph on a black background.  
Great for sentiment analysis on social media or academic presentations.  
Code is written in Python and designed for Google Colab.  
Input: CSV file with a column of text (e.g., tweets or messages).  
Output: Detected emotions + animated emotion trend plot.  
All source code is included in the uploaded Word document.
